# Intro

The Forge is a souped up replacement for the extension installations system supporting things like demo content and extras. Things like compatibility issues, perquisites, vulnerabilities are all handled seamlessly. The forge will seriously cut down on time spent maintaining your Joomla! site. The forge can pull from multiple forges allowing individual extension providers to run their own forge backends. You wont be locked into using Design BreakDown's forge. 

The Forge comes in two flavors; as a Joomla! installation script and as a component.

The installer is a super powered jumpstart system that allows you to install extensions during the installation phase of your Joomla! site. Component can be found at [http://github.com/bookworm/forge_com5](https://github.com/bookworm/forge_com5)

# The Inspiring Ideas and People. 

A project is more than just the sum of its code + coders, the ideas, think time, and non dev contributors involved to produce
that code extends far beyond the number of lines. Thought-lines and inspiring ideas span a wide spectrum of content management
systems and communities. I'd like to thank some of those people, projects, and communities now.

1. First and the foremost my Joomla! clients who made me realize how much easier a jumpstart can make setting up a Joomla! site.

2. JoomlaXTC for having me work on their jumpstarts and making me realize how much of pain properly cloning a demo site can be.  

3. BackupBuddy (WP), VaultPress (WP) and Akeeba Backup(Joomla!) for their respective WordPress site cloning and Joomla! site
  cloning projects. Without these guys I would never have thought up the idea of the forge in the first place.   
       
4. Acquia for their custom Drupal packages and their Drupal Gardens system.      
  
5. Simplweb for inspiring me to think about how to make Joomla! simpler.         
  
6. Kyle Ledbetter for his Joomla! admin projects which inspired me to seriously think about how to make Joomla! admin simpler.

7. Drupal demo module for making Drupal snapshots possible, without which I would never started thinking about jumpstarts all  
  those years ago. And by "all those years ago" I mean, four years ago. Oh how the web moves so fast.

Thanks everyone! You inspire me and make me a better developer.
